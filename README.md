# grabbit

Plugin-based media grabber. Paste a link in the web UI; the file streams to your
device while a copy is saved on the server.

- URL: https://grabbit.mecloud.win
- Saved copies: `/mnt/4tb/grabbit` on the host (`/data` in the container)
- Stack: Node + Express, yt-dlp + ffmpeg for the generic fallback

## How it works

1. `GET /api/resolve?url=...` picks the matching extractor and returns metadata
   (incl. `duration` and `tooLongForShorts`).
2. The web UI starts a **background job** (`GET /api/jobs/start?...`) and watches
   progress over SSE (`GET /api/jobs/stream`). The download runs server-side, so a
   long file no longer has to finish within the gateway timeout. When a job is
   done and `device=1`, the browser pulls the finished file from
   `GET /api/jobs/:id/file` (the file is already on disk, so bytes flow at once).
3. `GET /api/download?url=...` (synchronous, returns JSON or streams the file) and
   `GET /api/download-all` (SSE batch) are kept for elite-v2's internal grab
   integration, which calls grabbit over the docker network (no gateway timeout).

Any URL no dedicated extractor claims falls back to yt-dlp automatically.

### Long videos

Shorts are short clips, so a video longer than `SHORTS_MAX_DURATION` seconds
(default 600 = 10 min, `0` disables) is refused for the elite-v2 shorts
destination and routed to the plain server library instead. The web UI forces
the server library and shows a notice; the elite path and the batch downloader
skip known-long clips.

## Adding a new site

Drop a file in `extractors/` that exports:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'example',
  match(url) { return new URL(url).hostname.endsWith('example.com'); },
  async resolve(url) {
    return {
      kind: 'direct',                 // or 'ytdlp'
      filename: 'creator-id.mp4',
      title: '...',
      thumbnail: '...',
      downloadUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/real.mp4',
      headers: { Referer: 'https://example.com/' }, // headers the CDN requires
    };
  },
};
```

See `extractors/nuditok.js` for a real example (SPA whose real URL only comes
from a private API). The registry in `extractors/index.js` auto-loads every file
except `index.js` and `generic.js`.

## Deploy

Compose lives at `/home/thomas/docker2/compose/grabbit/`.

```bash
cd /home/thomas/docker2/compose/grabbit
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

Rebuild is only needed when `package.json` or the Dockerfile changes; for plain
code edits the same applies because the source is copied into the image (no bind
mount), so always `docker compose build && up -d` after editing extractors.
